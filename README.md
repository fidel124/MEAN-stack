The OpenShift `nodejs` cartridge documentation can be found at:

I used Angularjs at the frontend, I used Expressjs, Nodejs at the backend and them mongoDB as the databased. It also serve as a host to
my "sales Analysis" project which I used c3js and other technologies.

This MEAN-stack app requires a working database to work. It is built in my testing free openshift server, a working setup of it is
on this link: http://web-fidapp.rhcloud.com/  although the server goes to sleep somethings since it is not a paid server ( that is the 
condition for a free server).
